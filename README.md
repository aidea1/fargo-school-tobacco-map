This repository hosts an interactive, web-based geospatial map assessing the proximity of tobacco and vape retail outlets to public schools in Fargo, North Dakota. The project quantifies environmental exposure by measuring distances between schools and nearby tobacco-related retailers and identifying schools located within common policy-relevant buffer zones (e.g., 300 m, 500 m, 1,000 m). The dashboard is built using Leaflet/Folium and deployed as a static site via GitHub Pages for public access and policy engagement.

This project applies spatial epidemiology methods to characterize the retail tobacco environment surrounding public schools in Fargo, ND. Using geocoded school locations and tobacco/vape retailer data from Google Places, great-circle distance metrics are computed to identify proximity-based exposure patterns. Results are visualized through an interactive map designed to support tobacco control policy discussions and school health planning.
